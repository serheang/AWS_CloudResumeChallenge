## Construction timeline

I am just a simple IT guy who try to complete the [Forrest Brazeal Cloud Resume Challenge](https://cloudresumechallenge.dev/docs/the-challenge/aws/).  Here will be empty for now.   

**20221103**  
Here is [my gitrepo](https://github.com/serheang/AWS_CloudResumeChallenge) which I am keeping a tap on what I am doing and how I am going to do it.  

**20221106**  
I am keeping this static page in my [gitrepo](https://github.com/serheang/AWS_CloudResumeChallenge) too.  
This static HTML page is first written in markdown (md), which I am grateful to learn from Matt Cone through his [Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/).  

**20221109**  
Trying to figure out how to put in Javascript visitor counter onto this md/html.
